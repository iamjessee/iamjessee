👋🏾 Welcome! I'm Jesse, currently a DevOps contractor at Microsoft, focused on automating and maintaining macOS infrastructure. I'm driven by a passion for automation, and building systems that work seamlessly behind the scenes.

### 🔧 Technical Stack:
```csharp
var skills = new {
    Automation = new[] { "Chef", "Vagrant", "Parallels", "CI/CD" },

};
```
### 🪴 Current Focus  
I'm focused on DevOps engineering and macOS infrastructure automation. At work, I use Chef, Vagrant, and Ruby to provision virtual machines and streamline configuration workflows. On GitHub, I’m building a portfolio of small backend projects and scripts as I continue to sharpen my automation and API development skills.
