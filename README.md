Hi there 👋🏾 Welcome to my GitHub! Over the past year, I've been diving deep into programming, focusing on C# and .NET development, and now expanding my knowledge into web development with JavaScript, React, and TypeScript. My journey is driven by curiosity, a love for problem-solving, and a commitment to building quality software.

###🌱 Current Focus:
I’m currently working on complex, real-world projects that incorporate front-end and back-end development. My latest projects include an investment tracker that pulls real-time stock data, a review API application, and various CRUD-based applications. Through these projects, I’m honing my skills in ASP.NET Core, RESTful APIs, and database management.

###💻 Professional Aspirations:
I'm actively seeking junior developer roles where I can contribute, collaborate, and grow in a team setting. While I may be early in my journey, I’m dedicated to learning and contributing meaningfully. I also aim to start contributing to open-source projects to deepen my understanding of collaborative coding practices.

###🔧 Technical Stack:
```csharp
var skills = new {
    Languages = new[] { "C#", "JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS" },
    Frameworks = new[] { ".NET Core", "ASP.NET", "React", "Entity Framework" },
    Databases = new[] { "SQL Server", "PostgreSQL" },
    Tools = new[] { "Git", "GitHub", "Swagger" }
}; 
```
###🚀 My Approach:
I believe in continuous improvement and learning through hands-on experience. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and following SOLID principles and best practices in OOP. My GitHub showcases a mix of personal projects that reflect my growth and experimentation.

###📫 Let’s Connect!
I'm always open to collaboration and feedback. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect, discuss ideas, or have a project I might contribute to.
